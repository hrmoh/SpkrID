## My BS Project program

## Warning:

### The code is compiled against Visual C++ 6.0 and although I managed to compile it under Visual Studio 2019 (with some minor changes regarding loop variables), it is not possible to link it unless you get access to compatible versions of library (.lib) files required.

This is my selected BS final project. I wanted to design a system, which identifies its registered users from their voice passwords, which they stated previously. My system primarily should be capable of comparing two pieces of speech and it should have a simple database system for storing and retrieving patterns resulted from theses pieces.

I first started to search for available scientific resources and free and open source libraries and programs related to this topic. Finally I selected Jialong He's free library for speech/speaker recognition as a base for my work and my final work is a simple text-dependent speaker identification system which uses MFCC features extracted from speech signal as speech patterns and compares them using dynamic time wrapping method.

Code and its paper is developed around 2002 and I cannot provide any support on it by now.
